# Predicting-Readability-of-Text

This project was done as part of the CommonLit Readability Prize Competition held on Kaggle.
The concepts used in this project include - 
1) Data Augmentation
2) Stylometric Analysis using features - Part Of Speech (POS) tags, number of syllables, number of easy words as given by the Dale Easy words list and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags.
3) Word Embeddings - Used pre-trained word2vec embeddings that were converted to Glove embeddings. The pre-trained embeddings can be found here - https://www.kaggle.com/pkugoodspeed/nlpword2vecembeddingspretrained
4) Various machine learning and basic deep learning models were used.
